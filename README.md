A simple flutter app for my degree final year project

#### Tech Stack
- `Flutter` (thorough docs)
- `Material 3 UI` (default ady, and BORDER RADIUS FTW)
- `Firebase` (bcs got nice docs n easy flutter integration)
- `HuggingFace Spaces` (free hosting)
- `FastAPI` (to wrap my ML model)
- `Docker` (to containerize the API to be put into HuggingFace)
